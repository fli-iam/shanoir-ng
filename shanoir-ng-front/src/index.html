Its origin goes back to neuroimaging, but its usage is now open for all kind of organs. It provides a user-friendly, secure web access and offers an intuitive workflow to facilitate the collecting and retrieving of imaging data from multiple sources and a wizzard to make the completion of metadata easy. Shanoir-NG comes along with many features such as pseudonymization of data for all imports, automatic NIfTI conversion and support for multi-centres clinical studies.",
